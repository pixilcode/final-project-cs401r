# Random notes
- functions only accept a single argument and return a single value - convenient for me
- allowed for a union type
- need to figure out how to deal with function arguments
  - should I require functions to have type annotations?
  - can I figure out types from the body?
  - should I just use an `Any`, then try to narrow it down from there?
